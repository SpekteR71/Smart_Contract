# Smart_Contract
A bunch of tokens created on ERC20 standards as part of an attempt to digitize stocks.
This project was a part of a problem statement in an IEEE hackathon. The tokens were deployed on the Goerli test network based on Ethereum mainnet.
A liquidity pool of the same tokens was also created to enable trading of the tokens. The transactions were tracked on etherscan.
